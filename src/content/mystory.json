... First of all I would like to thank you for visiting my website. I am Gabi and I am a Freelance Web Developer. I live in London since 2010, but I am originally from Hungary. I have graduated as a Computer Engineer back in 2010, specialized in Web and Network technologies. Since then I did not work in IT, instead for several reasons I have chosen Retail Management to be my career for 8 years. In the beginning of 2018 I have made a decision - to choose a career which gives me a better work-life balance, so I started studying and studying and some more studying. Obviously I had a lot from the basics from my studies from 2006-2010, but a lot of things has changed since so while working full fime as a Retail Manager I spent most of my time studying, programming, learning mostly from Youtube and basically from anywhere on the Internet. Currently I am working as a Freelance Web Developer. If you would like to get in touch with me for any reason, please do not hesitate to contact me.
