		<h1>Hello and welcome...</h1>
		<p>My name is Gabi and I am an Entry Level Web Developer. I have created this website as a portfolio work. I have been living in London since 2010, but I was born in Hungary, this is where I graduated as a Computer Engineer(BSc).</p>
		<img id="profile_pic" src={Profile} alt="profile_pic" />
		<p>- Hungary is the home of many great scientists such as JÃ¡nos Neumann (John von), who invented and developed the first working Digital Computing System. -</p>
		<p> As a new Graduate, I was specialized in Web and Network technologies. Since then I have not worked in IT, instead - for several reasons - I have chosen Retail Management as a new, exciting and beneficial career field for 8 years. As a new year's resolution of 2018, I have made a decision - to choose a career which gives me a better work-life balance, so I started studying online to refresh my knowledge and catch up with the new trend. I was and still am astonished to see how much has the IT industry improved, and the fact that I can keep up with the change leaves me more and more determined every day. While was working full time as a Retail Manager I spent most of my time studying, programming, learning from different sources, basically from anywhere on the Internet. </p>
		<p>Web development has become my new life's essence. I find it fascinating when you learn to solve a problem and that makes you learn something else connecting to a different issue. The complexity of creating Web Applications unleashes my creativity, there are no limits.</p>
		<p> I have done my works using mainly HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, React so far. I am just getting familiar with Google`s Firebase and the beta Firestore as well.</p>
		<p>Apart from this music makes my days even more colorful. I am a singer and musician myself (I play and listen mostly blues and hard rock) I love going to concerts as many as I can. Thank you for visiting my page. If you would like to reach me, please do not hesitate and scroll to the contact me section.</p>
